<p>BookGanga is a platform that allows you to borrow and share books from people near you (Kind of like Tinder for readers). You can form your book clubs and also chat with other users. You can put your books up for sharing either for free or some nominal charges. Now you can earn money with books in your bookshelf. You can also post blogs and reviews of books you have read. </p>
<p>This app has been made using Flutter Framework. Backend of the project is private for security reasons.</p>
